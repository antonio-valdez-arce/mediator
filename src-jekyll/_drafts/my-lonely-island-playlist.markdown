Somewhere I heard the concept of "Lonely island playlist" which it's a list of songs you would take with you in case you were going to stay in a lost island. That would give you an idea what songs you like the most. For me it was really hard to decide!

So here's my list. The order is not important:

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

6.

7.

8.

9.

10.


## List of tracks and description (tell why?)
## Include grooveshark widgets.
