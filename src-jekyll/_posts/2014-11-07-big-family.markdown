As a mexican living abroad i find it funny when i hear stereotypes about us and our country. So with this post i start a series of mexican stereotypes and will give my opinion (objective opinion of course) about wether they are true or false.


## What they say: Mexican families are huge!

All around i hear this and also jokes about it. But i can't say it's a lie. Taking my family as an example, from my father's side i have 7 uncles and 2 aunts and from my mother's side 3 uncles and 5 aunts. This gives me an unknown number of cousins as every uncle and aunt have at least 3 children. 

We have a Whatsapp group with my cousins (father's side) and there are more than 50 memebers on the list, meaning the number of cousins at an age of having a phone. Everyday i wake up in the morning and i find more than 100 unread messages, it's amazing :)

All my family is spread around the country, so there are members i don't know yet and i have to admit, some others that i would not recognize if i met them on the street. 

Anyway, i like to have such a big family, i'm just proud of it when people get surprised by it.
