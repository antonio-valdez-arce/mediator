## It's decided

Antonio is blogging!

Ok already, enough with the fancy third person, I finally created my first blog and we'll see if I can keep up with the content. My plan is to post from time to time things i do or think to share them with family and friends. Also i will try to write some things related with my profession just for myself, it's just easier to learn if I land stuff in some place.

So it's done, I already blogged!, I've started, this is my first post and the [cover picture of the blog](/assets/images/cover-izmir.jpg) is from our trip to Turkey in 2007, the Izmir main square was so colorful and warm that day. I used my old Lomo camera.

Check more info about this blog going to the [About](/about/) page.

Nara!
